    "# 1. Physical Description for the generators \n",
    "\n",
    "Thermal Generators, or *Thermal Power Station, is a power station in which heat energy is converted into electric power* [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_power_station#Types_of_thermal_energy). Thermal generators operate on different type of fuels (coal, natural gas, petroleum, nuclear, ...), but for the initial purpose of this model, coal and gas are the main fuel sources of concern. \n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.1 Market Description \n",
    "\n",
    "The `Thermal_Generator` assumes that the generators participate in the electricity day-ahead market, in which the generator operator would have to optimize their operation strategy based on their given as well as forecasted information (electricity, fuel, carbon prices) in order to determine the optimal dispatch strategy for the generator (when to start up, operate in low/high power mode, when to shut down). \n",
    "\n",
    "Data regarding the markets must be provided to the model, including: electricity, fuel and carbon price for the specified time interval (the time resolution must be in the unit of one hour). \n",
    "\n",
    "- Electricity price ($€/MWh_{e}$): this is the price on the electricity day-ahead market. For the date of the markets participating on the *EPEX SPOT* power exchange, the `EPEX_Scrapping` module is design to help you automatically acquire the data given on their website.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Fossil Fuel Price ($€/MWh_{th}$): this is the price of fossil fuels (some time the energy unit is in Btu, but for the purpose of simplicity, we use MWh thermal as the standard unit)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Carbon Price ($€/tCO_{2}$ or $€/EA$, $EA = 1 \\text{ tonne of } CO_{2}$ ) : carbon emission price, they will be traded in the unit of *Emission Allowance (EA)*, which is equivalent to one tonne of $CO_{2}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Apart from the EPEX SPOT, other useful sources of data can be found in : [EEX](https://www.eex.com/en#/en), [Quandl](https://www.quandl.com/) or [ICE](https://www.theice.com/futures-europe). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.2 Technical Operation and Expenses Description \n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on the comparison between the price of electricity and the short-term marginal cost for the time horizon of interest, the generator's operator will decide to turn on the generator (Cold Start-up), shut down or switching between different generation modes (low, high, maximum powers with different efficiencies). The objective is to minimize the operational cost as well as maximize the revenue coming from the electricity day-ahead market (DAM). \n",
    "\n",
    "- Start-up : cold startup is the a very costly operation with a thermal generator (~ 40,000 € for a coal-fired generator, depending on the nominal power). If the operator decides to turn on the generator, the generator cannot generate electricity within a certain amount of time (`Startup_cold_time`), typical value for a Combined Cycle Gas Turbine (CCGT) is 2 hours and 10 for coal. The formula for start-up cost is as follow ([ref](https://www.stiftung-mercator.de/media/downloads/3_Publikationen/nature_energy_Start-up_costs__of_thermal_power_plants.pdf), [ref](https://www.diw.de/documents/publikationen/73/diw_01.c.524200.de/dp1540.pdf))\n",

    "    \\text{Startup Cost }(€/MW_{nominal}) = \\text{required Startup fuel } (MWh_{th}/MW_{nominal}) \\times \\text{fuel price } (€/MWh_{th}) + \\text{Startup Depreciation Cost } (€/MW_{nominal})\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "- Shutdown : in this model, shutdown does not generate expenses but does put a minimum off time constraint on the generator, which means that the generator can't be operational for at least `Minimum_downtime` hours from the moment where the shutdown signal is made.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Operation modes : the generators can operate on different modes with different power with different efficiencies (e.g. operates at 40% nominal power to minimize losses when DAM price is low, but not that low to be shut down completely). Efficiency will be lower than the nominal one (thermodynamics!). \n",
